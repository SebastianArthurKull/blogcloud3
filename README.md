As a Users you can write posts and read other peoples posts. There is a comment section on every post where you can write and read comments.
You can follow other people and take part of their journey. In addition, you can Like posts.

### Technologies
In this project I use **Next.js** with **React.js** and **json-server** as our API Endpoint
For the design I use **Bootstrap** and **Boostrap-Icons**
### Users
It's possible to Register, login, logout and edit your profile

### Post
It's possible to get, create, edit and delete your posts 

### Comments
It's possible to get, create, edit and delete your Comments

## Conclusion
Time runs very fast. So it's really important to plan every day. Working on a good Mockup and planing everything is really significant. Every wrong decision can cost hours afterwards in debugging.
Putting the logical work on the wrong class can be really annoying to lift afterwards. Better planning for the next project will be a must.
I really loved doing this project. This was the first time working on my own on a project with this complexity. 

### TODO (Stuff do rework)
- Password validation while Register. Server validates the input and not the frontend.
- Implement one Fetch for every Page
- Image upload with a clear logic (Buggy at the moment and Errors on the Browser Console)
- Likes on the Comment section
- Connect to a real Backend
- Rework the Design. (Dark-mode, Images...)
